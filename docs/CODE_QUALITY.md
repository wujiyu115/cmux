# Code quality guidelines

For contributors and AI assistants: builds on [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) with **file size, layering, testing, and known limitations** so pages and cubits do not grow without bound and test gaps stay visible.

## Quality gates (required)

Before merge, from `client/` (same as [Client Build Verify](../.github/workflows/client-verify.yml)):

```bash
cd client
flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos --no-fatal-warnings
flutter test --exclude-tags integration
```

Run these commands and confirm success before claiming work is done.

### Touched a native dependency? Compile a desktop target too

If your change adds, removes or re-pins anything in `pubspec.yaml` that ships native code, also run:

```bash
cd client
flutter build macos --debug
```

Neither gate above can see a `pod install` failure, and an iOS build cannot either — deployment targets are per-platform. Adding `speech_to_text`, which requires macOS 11.0, broke the desktop build against a project targeting 10.15 and stayed broken for an entire subproject because analyze and the test suite both stayed green.

CI does not close this gap today: the `verify` matrix in [client-verify.yml](../.github/workflows/client-verify.yml) lists Linux, Windows and macOS, but its only compile step is `flutter build ios` — those three rows run analyze and the tests and never build the app. Until that changes, compiling a desktop target locally is the only check.

## Layering

| Layer | Path | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Single-screen module | `pages/<domain>/` | Route **shell** (`*_page.dart` / `*_workspace.dart`), sections, dialogs, route helpers (see `pages/config/`) |
| Shared UI | `packages/shared_ui` (`Tp*`) | Cross-route design-system primitives (Button, Input, Select, Dialog, Form, Deferred mount / KeepAlive, …) |
| Product / domain chrome | `widgets/` | App-specific layout and chrome reused across routes (`dropdown/`, `settings/`, `split_layout.dart`, etc.) — not generic controls |
| State | `cubits/` | Actions, loading/error; calls repositories / services |
| Persistence | `repositories/` | JSON/files via `Filesystem` + `AppStorage` |
| Domain | `services/` | Terminal transport, PTY/SSH, git, file tree, storage, agent-status |
| Models | `models/` | Immutable data, serialization |

**Paths:** `AppStorage` / `RuntimeContextRegistry` only — not `Directory.current` for workspace or app data roots.

**DI:** Services that touch processes, network, or disk should accept injectable runners/clients (see `GitService({GitCommandRunner? runner})`, injected `Filesystem`, `TerminalTransportFactory`).

## Seven design principles

Apply these when adding or refactoring code. They complement the layering table above — not a substitute for it.

| Principle | Rule of thumb | In TeamPilot |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Single responsibility** | One class/file has one reason to change. | Split oversized cubits/services (see [file size](#file-size-soft-limits)); `SessionLaunchService` owns launch orchestration, `SessionLifecycleService` owns provisioning — do not merge unrelated flows. |
| **Open/closed** | Open for extension, closed for modification. | Keep CLI-specific handling behind small seams in `services/cli/` + `models/cli_tool.dart` instead of scattering `if (cli == …)` across pages and cubits. |
| **Liskov substitution** | Subtypes must honor the contract of the base type. | Fakes in tests (`Filesystem`, transport runners) must behave like production implementations at the boundary you mock; do not rely on “test-only” quirks callers do not expect. |
| **Interface segregation** | Prefer small, focused interfaces over fat ones. | Cubits depend on narrow service seams (constructor injection), not whole `AppShell` or god-objects. |
| **Dependency inversion** | Depend on abstractions, not concretions. | Inject `Filesystem`, `TerminalTransportFactory`, subprocess runners, and repositories from `app_shell.dart` / tests — no hidden `Process.run` or disk access inside `build()` or static singletons in feature code. |
| **Law of Demeter** | Talk to immediate collaborators; avoid long chains. | Pages `context.read<Cubit>()` and call cubit methods; cubits call services/repositories — avoid `context.read<A>().read<B>().foo` or reaching through three layers of internal state from UI. |
| **Composition over inheritance** | Favor composing objects/widgets over deep subclass trees. | Compose `pages/<domain>/` sections, `shared_ui` `Tp*` primitives, and small product `widgets/`; use widget composition and capability composition — limit deep inheritance except where Flutter/SDK requires it. |

When a change violates more than one principle, fix structure first (split file, inject dependency, add capability) before adding behavior.

### `pages/` vs `widgets/` vs `shared_ui`

| Question | Location | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Used by a single route / settings screen? | `pages/<domain>/` | `pages/config/session_config_section.dart`, `pages/home_workspace/workspace/workspace_config_section.dart` |
| New cross-route **design primitive** (button, input, select, dialog, form, deferred mount, …)? | `client/packages/shared_ui` as `Tp*` | `TpButton`, `TpInput`, `TpSelect`, `TpDialog`, `TpForm`, `TpDeferredMountShell` |
| Product / domain chrome imported from unrelated routes? | `widgets/` | `DesktopWindowTitleBar`, `ResizableSplitView`, `SidebarSessionTile` |
| Page shell + sections colocated? | `pages/<domain>/*_page.dart` (may `export` types from the domain subfolder) | `config_workspace.dart`, `workspace_page.dart` |

**Do not** put route-only sections under `widgets/<feature>/` when the folder name mirrors a page. When splitting oversized pages, prefer **`pages/<domain>/`**, aligned with `pages/config/`.

**Do not** add new generic controls under `client/lib/widgets/` — put them in `packages/shared_ui` as `Tp*` components. Keep `widgets/` for product/domain chrome only.

**Progressive paint** (Frame 0 chrome → skeletons → content → idle heavy controls): see [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md).

Suggested layout (**shell and sections colocated**, see `pages/config/` and `pages/home_workspace/workspace/`):

```
pages/
  config/
    config_workspace.dart
    session_config_section.dart
    shortcuts_config_section.dart
    ...
  home_workspace/
    home_workspace_shell.dart
    workspace/
      workspace_page.dart
      workspace_config_section.dart
      ...
  ssh_profiles/
    ssh_profiles_section.dart
    ...
```

## File size (soft limits)

| Kind | Soft limit |
|------|------------|
| Page / workspace shell | ~400 lines |
| Single file under `pages/<domain>/` | ~500 lines (split further or extract **shared** widgets) |
| `cubits/` | ~500 lines |
| `services/` | ~600 lines |

**Do not** add large UI or business blocks to pages already **~800+ lines** without splitting and adding tests.

**Generated:** `l10n/app_localizations*.dart` is excluded from these limits; never hand-edit.

## UI and state

- Route-specific UI lives under **`pages/<domain>/`**; cross-route **design primitives** under **`packages/shared_ui`** (`Tp*`); product/domain chrome under **`widgets/`**. Pages connect via `BlocBuilder` / `context.read`.
- **Use `flutter_bloc` (Cubit) for app state**; do not introduce `provider` / `ChangeNotifier` as a parallel pattern in feature code.
- Cubit states: `Equatable` or immutable `copyWith`; explicit load/error; fine-grained busy sets where needed (`GitCubit`, `FileTreeCubit`).
- User-facing errors: l10n, not raw `e.toString()` as final copy (logging is fine).
- Routing: existing **`go_router`** (`app_router.dart`); short-lived UI (dialogs, sheets) may use `Navigator`.

### Flutter UI practices (when splitting large pages)

When touching oversized files (`chat_cubit.dart`, `home_workspace_shell.dart`, `editor_cubit.dart`, etc.), reduce size this way—not by growing a single file:

| Practice | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| Dedicated **Widget classes** | Split large `build()` bodies into `class FooSection extends StatelessWidget` under **`pages/<domain>/`**. **Avoid** private methods that only return a `Widget`. |
| Composition over inheritance | Compose small widgets; limit deep `Row`/`Column` nesting. |
| Long lists | Use **`ListView.builder` / `SliverList`** for file trees, session lists, and Git changes; avoid huge `children: [...]`. |
| Keep `build()` light | **No** disk/network/subprocess, heavy JSON parse, or heavy compute inside `build()`; use Cubit/Service + `BlocBuilder`. |
| `const` | Use `const` constructors where subtrees are stable to cut unnecessary desktop rebuilds. |
| Typography | In `pages/` and `widgets/`, text styles must come from [`TpTextStyles`](../client/packages/shared_ui/lib/src/theme/tp_text_styles.dart) **named scale tokens** (`md`, `mdSemibold`, `xsBoldWide`, …) or other theme helpers (`tpDropdownFieldTextStyle`, `appMonoTextStyle`, `appTerminalTextStyle`, …). Do **not** construct `TextStyle(...)` inline, set `fontSize` / `letterSpacing` / `fontWeight` / `height` via `copyWith`, use raw `ThemeData.textTheme`, or invent combinations outside shipped getters. Prefer `*Colored` / `muted*`. Exceptions: syntax highlighting, terminal `TerminalStyle`, size-driven avatar glyphs, diff views that inherit editor font metrics. Every new `TpTextStyles` getter must be covered by `stylesForWarmup` / host warmup extras. |

Shared pieces for multiple sections on the **same** screen stay in the **same** `pages/<domain>/` folder. When a second route needs them: use **`packages/shared_ui`** for design primitives (`Tp*`), or **`widgets/`** for product/domain chrome only.

## Function and logic size

- One responsibility per function; past **~30 lines** with branches and IO, move logic to `services/` or a dedicated widget.
- Cubit handlers past **~40 lines** should delegate domain steps to services; the cubit orchestrates and `emit`s.

## Errors and logging

- Expected failures (install failed, probe miss) → result types or cubit error state; **no** silent catches.
- User copy → **l10n + cubit state**; diagnostics → **`AppLogger`** (`utils/logging/logger.dart`). **No** `print`; do not rely on `debugPrint` as persistent logging.
- Follow [DEBUGGING.md](DEBUGGING.md) for framework/engine errors before changing app logic.

## Models and code generation

- Persistence/API models: **`json_serializable` + `json_annotation`**; after edits run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` ([DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)).
- New models should match **existing models in the same domain** for JSON keys and `@JsonSerializable` options.
- `///` docs on **`services/`, `repositories/`, and shared models**; page sections rely on clear names.

## Desktop layout

- Wide forms (app settings, workspace manage): **`Expanded` / `Flexible` / `Wrap`** for `Row` overflow; `SingleChildScrollView` for fixed large blocks; lists still use builders.
- Use `LayoutBuilder` / `MediaQuery` when needed; shared mobile/desktop widgets should respect max width and touch targets.

## Accessibility (baseline)

- Icon-only controls: **`tooltip` or `Semantics(label: …)`**.
- Contrast and type via **`ThemeData` / `textTheme`**, not hard-coded low-contrast pairs.
- Verify forms/sidebars remain scrollable and actionable with system text scaling.

## Testing

### Default (CI)

```bash
flutter test --exclude-tags integration
```

New features: unit-test `services/`, `repositories/`, `cubits/` first.
When editing large pages: at least **cubit** tests; newly extracted **`pages/<domain>/`** sections should get **widget tests** (key interactions, empty/error states).
Structure: **Arrange–Act–Assert** (or Given–When–Then); one behavior per `test`.

### Integration tests

- Tag: `@Tags(['integration'])`.
- Real PTY/CLI; excluded from default CI — see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).
- Document local run steps in PRs; aim for **2–3 golden paths** over time (e.g. open a workspace session → shell connects and echoes input).

### Test environment

If code touches `AppStorage` / `RuntimeContextRegistry`:

- `setUpTestAppStorage()` / `tearDownTestAppStorage()` in `client/test/support/post_frame_test_harness.dart`.
- Avoid cubit tests that trigger background work without storage — warnings like `AppStorage home not bound` hide real failures.

For post-frame work (`ChatCubit`), use `PostFrameTestHarness` / `runScheduledCallback`.

### Fakes and mocks

- **Prefer fakes/stubs** (injected `Filesystem`, fake `runner` with fixed `ProcessResult`), as in `GitService` / `GitCommandRunner` tests.
- Use mocks only at hard boundaries; do not adopt `mockito` / `mocktail` by default for new tests.
- Mock when needed: subprocesses, SSH, network, uninitialized `AppStorage` side effects.
- Do not mock: pure functions, trivial types matching real behavior.
- Process flows: inject runners; do not run real subprocesses on the host.
- Keep integration tests on **`@Tags(['integration'])` + `package:test`** unless a repo-wide migration to `integration_test` is agreed.

## Bootstrap / `app_shell.dart`

- Wire new types explicitly on `AppShell`; avoid hidden singletons.
- If a single change adds **~80+ lines** to `app_shell.dart`, extract a domain bootstrap factory.
- Tests: `AppStorage.installForTesting` / `setUpTestAppStorage()`, not production bootstrap unless testing bootstrap itself.

## Dart conventions

- `async`/`await` + `try/catch` should surface outcomes in cubits/services, not unhandled exceptions in `build`.
- Naming: `PascalCase` types, `camelCase` members, `snake_case` files; avoid opaque abbreviations.
- From `pages/<domain>/`: `Tp*` primitives → `import 'package:shared_ui/shared_ui.dart'`; product chrome → `import '../../widgets/...'`; same domain → `import 'foo_section.dart'`.

## Tech debt

- Avoid new `TODO`/`FIXME` without an issue or same-PR follow-up.
- No `// ignore` without reason; fix analyze issues when possible.
- Comments explain **why**, not what the code obviously does; `///` on public service APIs; keep sections self-explanatory.
- Bugs: [DEBUGGING.md](DEBUGGING.md) — search framework errors before local hacks.

## Manual pre-release checks

- At least one desktop OS: create a workspace → open a session → terminal connects and accepts input.
- Git / worktree changes: stage/commit in the built-in Git panel, create and delete a worktree.
- Android/SSH: hand-test when storage or transport changes.
